# HTML: Markup Language vs. Programming Language
An article about HTML

### This article explores the distinction between HTML and programming languages.
Let's do a breakdown of what HTML entails.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation, or rather building block of every web page, it  tells the browsers how to structure the webpage layout, and from the name Markup Language, it seems clear why developers refuse to accept that it is a programming Language.  

### According to the official website of HTML 
HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

### If this isn't still convincing enough to let you know that HTML isn't a Markup Language , let's go through some of the core features of a programming language that HTML lacks thereby making it a markup language:
<ol>
<li>Libraries and Framework: Unlike HTML that lacks libraries and framework, programming languages like JavaScript,Python and PHP possess framework.</li>
<li> Paradigms:  As much as it looks like HTML has its own paradigms, it lacks traditional paradigms like object oriented, procedural or functional like programming languages have.</li>
<li> Control Structures:  Programming languages use control structures like conditional and switch statements (i.e: if-else, for, while e.t.c) for control in programming, HTML has a markup language, cannot create conditional logic.</li>

</ol>


Being a markup language does not limit HTML as whether it is a programming language or not, as HTML it is still the baseline of every web page, therefore the importance cannot be overlooked nor undermined.
